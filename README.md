# BCS Week 9, Node.js Challenge: Professional README Generator

## Getting Started

This project was to create a README generator within the command line. I started with the given code provided this week. I followed the Get Started Instruction provided:
Created a .gitignore file and include node_modules/ and .DS_Store/ so that my node_modules directory were not tracked or uploaded to GitHub. 
Made sure that my repo includes a package.json with the required dependencies. 
I utilized several tools including but not limited to Xpert Chat, Copilot, MDN, ChatGPT.
